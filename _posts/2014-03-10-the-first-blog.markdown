"The actual science of logic is conversant at present only with things either certain, impossible, or entirely doubtful, none of which (fortunately)
we have to reason on. Therefore the true logic for this world is the calculus of Probabilities, which takes account of the magnitude of the probability
which is, or ought to be, in a resonable man's mind" --James Clerk Maxwell (1850)

"Probability theory is nothing but common sense reduced to calculation" --Laplace (1819)

"I conceive the mind as a moving thing, and arguments as the motive forces driving it in one direction or the other" --John Craig (1699)

"Ignorance is preferable to error and he is less remote from truth who believes nothing than he who believes what is wrong" --Thomas Jefferson (1781)
